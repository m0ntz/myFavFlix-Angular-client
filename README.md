# FavFlix Angular (client-side)

## Description
A single-page, responsive movie app built with Angular, with routing and several interface views based on its existing [server-side code](https://github.com/m0ntz/movie-api) (REST API and database).

Users are able to use the app whenever they want to read information about different movies or update their user information.

## Tech Stack

## Features
- The app displays a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an account.

additional movie details is displayed. The single movie view contains the following
additional features:

director of that particular movie will be displayed.
 ○ A button that when clicked takes a user to the genre view, where details about that
particular genre of the movie will be displayed.

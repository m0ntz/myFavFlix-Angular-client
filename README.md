## Description
A single-page, responsive movie app built with Angular, with routing and several interface views based on its existing [server-side code](https://github.com/m0ntz/movie-api) (REST API and database).

Users are able to use the app whenever they want to read information about different movies or update their user information.

## Tech Stack
- Angular
- TypeScript
- TypeDoc


## Features
- The app displays a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an account.
- Once authenticated, the user can see all movies.
- Upon clicking on a particular movie, users are taken to a single movie view, where
additional movie details is displayed. The single movie view contains the following
additional features:
 ○ A button that when clicked takes a user to the director view, where details about the
director of that particular movie will be displayed.
 ○ A button that when clicked takes a user to the genre view, where details about that
particular genre of the movie will be displayed.


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I
can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies

## Development Enviroment
### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
